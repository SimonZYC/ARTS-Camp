[10 Tips to Improve Programming Skill and become better Programmer, Developer](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/01/10-tips-to-improve-programming-skill-become-better-programmer.html)



In order to become a better programmer, you need to be really good at the data structure, algorithms, designing using OOPS, multi-threading and various programming concept e.g. recursion, divide and conquer, prototyping, and [unit testing](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/08/best-practices-to-write-junit-test.html).



## Tip1: Coding, coding and coding

- By doing coding, you also realize your mistakes in [designing](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2012/06/20-design-pattern-and-software-design.html), [error handling](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/03/0-exception-handling-best-practices-in-Java-Programming.html), [threading ](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2010/10/what-is-deadlock-in-java-how-to-fix-it.html)and then go back to those respective skills to improve. 

- After coming up with a solution, improve it. Your next solution should address issues, missing requirements which you have found building a prototype.

## Tip2: Reading Books

- Learn from others' codes.
- Clean Code, Effective Java
- More is not always good.

## Tip3: Contributing to Open Source, Signing-up mailing lists

## Tip4: Practicing data structure, Algorithms, and Design related problems

In the author's opinion, this is the most critical of things to do to become a better programmer.

Similarly, knowledge of key programming principles, search and sort algorithms and other well-known algorithms develop programming skills on you.

## Tip5: Reading Good Blogs

## Tip6: Reading Code

Find patterns, develop navigation skill, initially you will find it boring and difficult, but with time you will develop a good *code sense*, which will alert you when you do a mistake, help you to spot others mistake, gaps, and code smell.

## Tip7: Wrting Unit Test

[writing unit test](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/03/how-to-write-unit-test-in-java-eclipse-netbeans-example-run.html) helps a lot in finding better names, better abstraction, better interface and abstract class design and overall improves code quality.

## Tip8: Doing Code Review

## Tip9: Talking to a fellow programmer

## Tip10: Participating Stack Overflow and forums, Commenting in Blogs
